# This file will contain functions for interacting with the Google Sheets API.

# For each function, you'll need to use the Google Sheets API to create, read, update, and delete spreadsheets.
# To switch to a different spreadsheet service, you'll need to replace these functions with equivalent functions using the other service's API.
